# What is your site's primary purpose?
The primary purpose of my web site is to demonstrate my design, analysis, and development capability. I want to demonstrate this through capturing my Enspiral Dev Academy Journey, and using that as the foundation to show who I am as a web developer, and where I want to go with my career.

# Who is your target audience?
My target audience is anyone and everyone who would be inspired to work with me on a project, product, or service to be delivered. These can be fellow developers, fellow designers, fellow analysts, potential employers, potential clients, and professional connections.

# How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?
I want my site visitors to have a good experience no matter the devices they are using to access my site. I want them to have an easy time reading my portfolio, understanding who I am, and seeing the value I can bring to their development team. I also want to showcase my creative side through assets I have created and showcased with intuitive and interesting design.

# How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?
To support my desired user experience, I will:
* Use wireframes to design my page
* Ensure the designs are responsive to the device resolution
* Build the skeleton/scaffolding of the HTML and CSS
* Use placeholder text and image assets until I have the HTML/CSS working
* Experiment with typography from Google Fonts
* Experiment with colour tones using Adobe Color Wheel, and
* Build the content so that it tells the story of who I am, what I want to be, and how I want to get there.
